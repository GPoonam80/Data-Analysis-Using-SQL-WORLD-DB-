## Project Overview 🔍

This project explores the WORLD DB database using SQL to analyze global demographic, geographic, and economic patterns. It demonstrates practical applications of SQL in solving real-world problems and extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.

## Objectives 🎯

- **Understand Global Trends:** Analyze population, GDP, and life expectancy across countries.

- **Identify Patterns:** Highlight key urban demographics and economic hubs.

- **Enhance Skills:** Develop advanced SQL querying techniques.

## Key Features 🛠️

**SQL Querying:**

  - Data retrieval, filtering, and sorting.

  - Aggregation functions for insightful summaries.

  - Subqueries and joins for complex relationships.

**Data Cleaning:**

  - Addressed missing or duplicate records.

  - Standardized formats for consistency.

**Insights:**

  - Cities with the highest population.

  - Countries with the highest life expectancy and GDP per capita.

  - Demographic distributions in mid-size cities.

## Data Analysis Process 🗂️

  1. **Data Exploration:** Reviewed database schema and relationships.

  2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensured accuracy and consistency in data.

  3. **SQL Execution:** Ran targeted queries to solve predefined scenarios.

  4. **Insights Compilation:** Summarized findings with actionable points.
