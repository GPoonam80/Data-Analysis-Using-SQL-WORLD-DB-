## Project Overview 🔍

This project explores the WORLD DB database using SQL to analyze global demographic, geographic, and economic patterns. It demonstrates practical applications of SQL in solving real-world problems and extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.

Objectives 🎯

Understand Global Trends: Analyze population, GDP, and life expectancy across countries.

Identify Patterns: Highlight key urban demographics and economic hubs.

Enhance Skills: Develop advanced SQL querying techniques.

Key Features 🛠️

SQL Querying:

Data retrieval, filtering, and sorting.

Aggregation functions for insightful summaries.

Subqueries and joins for complex relationships.

Data Cleaning:

Addressed missing or duplicate records.

Standardized formats for consistency.

Insights:

Cities with the highest population.

Countries with the highest life expectancy and GDP per capita.

Demographic distributions in mid-size cities.

Data Analysis Process 🗂️

Data Exploration: Reviewed database schema and relationships.

Data Cleaning: Ensured accuracy and consistency in data.

SQL Execution: Ran targeted queries to solve predefined scenarios.

Insights Compilation: Summarized findings with actionable points.

Highlights 📈

Top Queries:

Count of cities in the USA: 🇺🇸

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM city WHERE country = 'USA';

Country with highest life expectancy: 🩺

SELECT country, MAX(life_expectancy) FROM country;

Cities with 'New' in their name: 🌟

SELECT * FROM city WHERE name LIKE '%New%';

Top 10 most populous cities: 🔝

SELECT * FROM city ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 10;

Key Findings:

High life expectancy reflects robust healthcare systems. 🏥

Urban density patterns vary significantly among countries. 🌆

"New York" and similar cities serve as economic and cultural hotspots. 🌍

Challenges ❓

Missing or inconsistent data.

Complex relationships requiring optimized queries.

Conclusion 🌟

This project showcases the utility of SQL in analyzing complex datasets. The insights derived can inform decisions in urban planning, healthcare, and economic investments. Future steps include integrating these analyses with visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI for enhanced impact.
